# Tiny-Drone
Project Goal
We are developing an ultra-compact unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using Arduino, integrated with an FPV camera to enable real-time video transmission. The UAV will be small in size, highly maneuverable, low-cost, and equipped with a stable control system using an IMU sensor. This project is designed so that anyone can easily build and program the UAV, while also learning about and understanding how drones work.

Project Description
The Arduino-based UAV project with FPV camera aims to develop a super-compact drone controlled via Arduino. The drone is lightweight, compact, highly maneuverable, and equipped with an FPV camera for real-time video transmission, helping pilots see from a first-person perspective as if they were on the drone. Additionally, the drone uses an IMU sensor for stable flight and optimized performance without using brushed or brushless motors. The low cost and high customization make this an excellent project for tech enthusiasts or anyone interested in learning how to control UAVs.
